# Chatbot Core
Bots using this framework connect to the Klat server and respond to user shouts. Bots will respond individually,
like any other user in the conversation.

## Getting Started
To utilize this repository for creating your own chat bots, install this package via pip and then extend the `ChatBot` or
`NeonBot` class to build your own chat bot (see the [Eexamples below](#python-examples)).

You can install this package with the following command:
`pip install git+https://github.com/neongeckocom/chatbot-core`

## Generating Responses
### Basic Bot
Basic bots override `self.ask_chatbot` to generate a response. Bots have access to the shout, the user who originated 
the shout, and the timestamp of the shout. Any means may be used to generate and return a response via 
the `self.propose_response` method.
### Script Bot
Bots extending the `NeonBot` class operate by passing user shouts to a Neon Script and returning those responses.
`NeonBot` init takes the name of the script to run (`"SCRIPT_NAME"` in the example below), 
as well as the messagebus configuration for the `NeonCore` instance on which to run the script.

## Testing
### Basic Bot
The response generation of a bot should be tested individually before connecting it to the Klat network. This can be 
accomplished by passing `on_server=False` and then calling `ask_chatbot` directly.
The [Python examples below](#python-examples) show how you can do this in the file containing your ChatBot.

### Script Bot
A script should be tested separately from the bot before creating a `NeonBot`. More information about developing scripts
can be found on [the Neon Scripts Repository](https://github.com/NeonGeckoCom/neon-scripts). After the script functions 
as expected, it can be used to extend a `NeonBot`.

## Proctored Conversations
Proctored conversations on the Klat network are conversations where multiple *subminds* (bots and users) may collaborate to
respond to incoming prompts. These conversations use a *Proctor* to pose questions and manage the voting and selection 
process among the multiple *subminds*. The following additional methods should be implemented to fully support 
participating in proctored conversations. It is not explicitly required to implement all methods, but doing so is recommended.

### ask_discusser
Override `ask_discusser` to provide some discussion of the proposed responses after all *subminds* have had an opportunity
to respond. Discussion can be anything, but generally is an endoresement of one of the proposed responses (a bot may 
endorse their own response).

### on_discussion
Override `on_discussion` to handle discussion responses from other *subminds*. A bot may use these responses to influence 
which bot/response they vote for, or possibly to affect their discussion of the next prompt.

### ask_appraiser
Override `ask_appraiser` to select a bot to vote for (a bot may not vote for themself). Any means may be used to select 
a bot; `options` provides a dictionary of valid names to vote for and their responses.

## Python Examples
